# The arydshln Package
The `arydshln` package is to draw dash-lines in array/tabular environments. Horizontal lines are drawn by `\hdashline` and `\cdashline` while vertical ones can be specified as a part of the preamble using ‘:’. The shape of dash-lines may be controlled through style parameters or optional arguments.

The package is compatible with array, colortab, longtable, and colortbl.
